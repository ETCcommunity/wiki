# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki


This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform built by ÐΞV including **Ethereum**, _the generalized blockchain for smart contract development_, and **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_.

## Status

### Homestead

The second major live release of Ethereum aka Homestead was released on 2016 Feb 29, and a successful hard fork took place on 2016 Mar 14! Development continues towards the versions named Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Homestead is aiming for [Ðapp developers](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Dapp-Developer-Resources) as well as end users for limited categories of applications, and Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/).

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit the Ethereum homepage over at [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by read the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki) and [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon),

## Downloads
Bleeding edge code can be cloned from the develop branch of their git repositories:
