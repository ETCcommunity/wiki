# Ethereum Classic

Ethereum Classic is a community building and supporting __Ethereum__ technologies and protocols. Ethereum Classic's origin relative to the [Ethereum Foundation](https://www.ethereum.org/foundation) came as a rejection the [EF DAO bailout](http://fintechist.com/ethereum-classic-gains-support-wake-dao-bailout/) in June 2016. Since then, Ethereum Classic has grown into it's own, forging paths in some ways parallel and in others divergent from it's hard-forked younger brother.

Etherum Classic's exchange ticker is __ETC__.

Ethereum Classic's core development team is __ETCDEV__, working alongside an immensely generous and capable community, to build and maintain a wide variety of projects.

Version 1.0 of Ethereum aka Frontier was released on July 30th 2015! Development continues towards the versions named Homestead, Metropolis and Serenity (v1.1). Frontier is aimed at exchangers and [miners](./Mining). Homestead is aiming for [√êapps developers](./Ethereum-Development-Tutorial), while Metropolis is aiming for end users with the release of the Mist browser. Serenity is meant to move from consensus through [Proof-of-Work](./Ethash) to [Proof-of-Stake](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/).

For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [development tutorial](./Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](./Glossary) and our [FAQ](./FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereumproject/cpp-ethereum/wiki) and [Go](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon),
