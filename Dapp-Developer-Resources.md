As a Ðapp developer you have three main resources which allow Ðapp development.

### Main Resources

- [Web3 JavaScript API](./JavaScript-API) - This is the main JavaScript SDK to use when you want to interact with a nodes API
- [JSON RPC API](./JSON-RPC) - This is the low level JSON RPC 2.0 interface to interface with a node. This API is used by the [Web3 JavaScript API](./JavaScript-API).
- [Solidity Documentation](https://ethereum.github.io/solidity/docs/home/) - Solidity is the Ethereum developed Smart Contract language, which compiles to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) opcodes.

### Other Resources:

- [Standardized Contract APIs](./Standardized_Contract_APIs) - Standard contract API, which should be used to make some contract types accessible by other Ðapps. (Not yet finalised)
- [Useful Ðapp Patterns](./Useful-Ðapp-Patterns) - Code snippets which are useful for Ðapp development.
- [Dapp using Meteor](./Dapp-using-Meteor) - This short tutorial gives an intro on how to start building a Ðapp using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), and also why Meteor is a good fit for Ðapps.
